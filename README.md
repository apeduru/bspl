# bspl
Bit-Shift-Print Loop

## Introduction

`bspl` is a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
for practising bit-wise operations. Aimed at undergraduates in CS/SE/ECE or
anyone that is interested in learning binary level manipulations.

## TODO

Learn how parsers work

Support for memory addressing

Base Conversions: define a standard method e.g. 16:10 AF (Convert hexadecimal value to decimal)

Operators: + - * / & | ~

Explain why this offers a richer experience compared to the Python REPL.

Add Octal to supported bases

Support for equality: ==
